# Cli Todo
A command line interface for creating and showing a todo list.

This project is meant to illustrate writing a todo program in different programming languages. Each language is placed in a different directory for easy navigation. Makefiles are used and are placed in each language directory that requires compiling before use. Built executables will go into the /build folder.

Each version should have the same interface, *Depending on each language's feature set*. They also should not need any other external libraries.
